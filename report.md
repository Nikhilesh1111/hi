    * The accuracy is :- 0.9811
    * Number of Support Vectors :- 7,7

### Part C)
* For C=0.0001:-
    * Train Error for Q=2 :- 0.00896
    * Train Error for Q=5 :- 0.00448
    * Train error for Q=5 is lower which contradicts the given statement hence its false.
* For C=0.001:-
    * Support Vectors for Q=2 :- 38,38
    * Support Vectors for Q=5 :- 13,12
    * Support Vectors for Q=5 is lower which follows the given statement hence its true.
* For C=0.01:-
    * Train Error for Q=2 :- 0.00448
    * Train Error for Q=5 :- 0.00384
    * Train error for Q=5 is lower which contradicts the given statement hence its false.
* For C=1:-
    * Test Error for Q=2 :- 0.01886
    * Test Error for Q=5 :- 0.02122
    * Test error for Q=5 is higher which contradicts the given statement hence its false.

### Part D)
* For C=0.01 :-
    * Train Error :- 0.00384
    * Test Error :- 0.02358
* For C=1 :-
    * Train Error :- 0.00448
    * Test Error :- 0.02122
* For C=100 :-
    * Train Error :- 0.00320
    * Test Error :- 0.01886
* For C=10000 :- 
    * Train Error :- 0.00256
    * Test Error :- 0.02358
* For C=1000000 :- 
    * Train Error :- 0.00064
    * Test Error :- 0.02358
* The lowest Training error is for C=1000000 (0.00064) and lowest test error is for C=100(0.01886).

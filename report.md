# Question 4
### Part A)
* The accuracy is :- 0.97877
* Number of Support Vectors :- 14,14

### Part B)
* For first 50 points:-
    * The accuracy is :- 0.9811
    * Number of Support Vectors :- 1,1
* For first 100 points:-
    * The accuracy is :- 0.9811
    * Number of Support Vectors :- 2,2
* For first 200 points:-
    * The accuracy is :- 0.9811
    * Number of Support Vectors :- 4,4
* For first 800 points:-
    * The accuracy is :- 0.9811
    * Number of Support Vectors :- 7,7

### Part C)
* For C=0.0001:-
    * Train Error for Q=2 :- 0.00896
    * Train Error for Q=5 :- 0.00448
    * Train error for Q=5 is lower which contradicts the given statement hence its false.
* For C=0.001:-
    * Support Vectors for Q=2 :- 38,38
    * Support Vectors for Q=5 :- 13,12
    * Support Vectors for Q=5 is lower which follows the given statement hence its true.
* For C=0.01:-
    * Train Error for Q=2 :- 0.00448
    * Train Error for Q=5 :- 0.00384
    * Train error for Q=5 is lower which contradicts the given statement hence its false.
* For C=1:-
    * Test Error for Q=2 :- 0.01886
    * Test Error for Q=5 :- 0.02122
    * Test error for Q=5 is higher which contradicts the given statement hence its false.

# Language Introduction

* _We are team 11 and we have developed a language taking inspiration from C and C++ ._
* _Basically our language is imperative(procedural) and we did not choose to write a declarative language as it is difficult to read,write and debug._
* _Our language is a broad language and its has uses similar to C and C++ and has many applications._
* _We have made our language user friendly and very easily understandable._
* _Our main goal was to make changes in C and C++ that we have faced during our little coding journey._

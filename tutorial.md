# Reference Manual

## INTRODUCTION
This is just a reference manual and detail information is present in appendix.Basically our language is derived taking inspiration from C and C++.
The uses of our language are similar to C and C++.Our language is an imperative(procedural) language.

## TOKENS AND COMMENTS
The main tokens in our language are identifiers,keywords,constants,string literals,operators and other separators.In our language to comment a block of statements enclose them in |< and >|.To comment a single line just put "->" in front of the statement.

## IDENTIFIERS AND KEYWORDS
In our language the names of identifiers should start with a letter and the keywords in our language are display,real,num,struct,if,else,repeat,length,list,append,insert,delete,return,string,void.

## CONSTANTS 
There are three types of constants in our language. They are integer,real and character constants.

## STRING LITERALS
A string literal also called a string constant is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes as in " ". A string has type "array of characters".

## IDENTIFIERS
Identifiers or names refer to a variety of things. An object sometimes called a variable is a location in storage and its interpretation depends on two main attributes its storage class and its type.
### BASIC DATA TYPES
Num,real are basic types
### DERIVED DATA TYPES
LISTS,STRINGS,FUNCTIONS,POINTERS,STRUCTURES

## CONVERSIONS
When an real is converted to integer type then decimal part is removed and when integer is converted to real type value next higest or lowest in the range of real is given to it.Many operators convert operands to common type and do ther operation first.

#### UNARY OPERATORS
The operators present in the language are @,*,-,~,.not.,sizeof()

#### OPERATORS 
Operators play the major role in any programming language.We cannot write any programs without these operators.

##### MULTIPLICATIVE AND ADDITIVE OPERATORS
The multiplicative operators present are *,/,$,^,+,-,%.

##### SHIFT OPERATORS
The left shift operator is << and the right shift operator is >>.

##### RELATIONAL AND EQUALITY OPERATORS
The operators are as follows
* .gt. -> greater than
* .lt. -> less than
* .lte. -> less than or equal to
* .gte. -> greater than or equal to
* .eq. -> equal to
* .neq. -> not equal to

##### BITWISE OPERATORS AND LOGICAL OPERATORS
* Bitwise -> &,@,|
* Logical -> .and.,.or.
* The assignment operator is -> =

### STATEMENTS
The main statements present are
* Expression statement -> assinging values,function calls.
* Compound statemennt  -> Used to filter out muliple statements to give one statement without changing logic.
* Selection statement  -> Used to perform different statements during difeerent cases.
* Iteration statement  -> Used for loops
* Jump statement       -> Used for jumping out of a loop or function.

### FUNCTIONS
Functions play a major role in programming language. They are used when we need to perform the same statements multiple times in a program. Duplicating the same piece of code is bad in any programming language so functions help us out. Functions take in arguments perform some statements and return the required output.

emsp;emsp;emsp;emsp; The syntax in our language is __function_name(input arguments) return_type(output parameter)__ 

* External declaration in functions : The scope of external declarations persists to the end of the translation unit in which they are declared.

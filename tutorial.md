# A Tutorial Introduction
&emsp;&emsp; In this we will give a brief introduction to our language.Our language is derived from C and C++.So you will expect the the uses of our language to be similar to that of C and C++ but we have tried it to make more user friendly.

## Getting Started
The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all language:  
Print the words  
hello, world  

In our language the program to print 'hello, world' is  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; include requiredlibraries  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; main()(int)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; {  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; display("hello, world \n");  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; }  

You can compile this code using the suitable compiler and then run it to get the output.

A program using our language whatever its size consists of functions and variables. A function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done and variables store values used during the computation. Our
